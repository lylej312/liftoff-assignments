## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project will be a bill tracker that allows users to track their bills, overview their expenses visually with a graphic, and organize all outgoing costs in one central location. Users will be able to log in to their account, create, edit and remove bills. They will be able to set a reminder for when an upcoming bill is due.

Our group chose this project because we all felt a connection with its core features-it'll be a central place to keep track of all bills. No longer will a bill be missed because it was at the bottom of a stack of paper or lost somewhere in the junk mail inbox. If you remember to put the bill into the bill tracker, you remember to pay it.

- User Sign up: Users will be able to create an account for themselves, giving them the ability to input their bills and set due dates.

- User Login: Users will be able to log in after creating a profile

- Edit, Create, Delete Bills: Users will be able to create, edit, and delete bills
